# Feature Suggestions

Here are some feature suggestions for the passphrase generator:

## 1. Support for Multiple Word Lists

Currently, the code only supports a single word list. Adding support for multiple word lists would allow users to choose which list to use when generating a passphrase.

## 2. Customizable Word List

Allowing users to create their own custom word lists, either by uploading a file or by entering words manually, would give them more control over the words used in the passphrase.

## 3. Passphrase Strength Analysis

Adding a feature that analyzes the strength of the generated passphrase, taking into account factors such as length, complexity, and entropy, would help users determine whether their passphrase is secure.

## 4. Passphrase Storage

Adding a feature that allows users to store generated passphrases securely, such as using a encrypted file or a password manager, would help users keep their passphrases safe.

## 5. Command-Line Options for Advanced Users

Adding more command-line options for advanced users, such as options to specify the word list, word count, and vowel replacement, would give them more control over the passphrase generation process.

## 6. Support for Different Languages

Adding support for generating passphrases in different languages, using language-specific word lists, would make the tool more useful for users who need to generate passphrases in multiple languages.

## 7. Passphrase Generation using Different Algorithms

Adding support for generating passphrases using different algorithms, such as using a Markov chain or a neural network, would give users more options for generating passphrases.

## 8. Integration with Password Managers

Integrating the passphrase generator with popular password managers, allowing users to easily store and retrieve generated passphrases, would make the tool more convenient to use.

## 9. Automated Testing

Adding automated tests to ensure that the code is working correctly and to catch any regressions would help ensure the quality of the tool.

## 10. Code Refactoring

Refactoring the code to make it more modular, maintainable, and efficient would make it easier to add new features and fix bugs.
